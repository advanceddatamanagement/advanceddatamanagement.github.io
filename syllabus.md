## Introduction

R is the most popular statistical programming language in the world.  R is used for data analytics and visualization in numerous fields, including medicine, and by some of the most successful companies and organizations in the world.  Amazingly, R is open-source and freely available! However, many students in the biomedical sciences have limited experience with programming and this creates a barrier to their adoption of tools like R in favor of less flexible and less powerful graphical user interface-based systems.  The avoidance of code also hampers one's ability to process and analyze data effectively, efficiently, and reproducibly.

## Course Objectives

The overarching objective of this course is to introduce the R statistical programming language with a focus on data management tasks (importing, cleaning, reshaping, transforming, and exploring data) and reproducible statistical analysis. While R packages for logistic and time-to-event modeling and for the creation of publication-quality figures and tables will be introduced, we will not spend much time on how to perform a given statistical analysis in R nor will we cover the underlying statistical theory of analyses.  Nevertheless, anyone who successfully completes the course will have acquired the skills to run any common statistical analysis available in R while gaining the much more valuable skills of creatively solving challenging data management problems.

## Prerequisites:
1. Completion of or concurrent enrollment in a basic statistics course covering at least linear regression (BIOS/MSCR 500 or equivalent).
2. A readiness to tackle problems and to think creatively to solve them
